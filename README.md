### üîß Backend Functionality
The backend of the Notebook App provides a robust set of APIs for interacting with notes and drawings:

<strong> Note APIs </strong>
- GET /api/notes: Retrieves all notes from the database.
- POST /api/notes: Creates a new note with the provided title, content, color, reminder date, labels, and image data (if applicable).
- PATCH /api/notes/:id/move-to-trash: Moves a note to the trash by setting its deleted field to true.
- PATCH /api/notes/:id/restore: Restores a note from the trash by setting its deleted field to false.
- DELETE /api/notes/:id: Permanently deletes a note from the database.
- PATCH /api/notes/:id/archive: Archives a note by setting its archived field to true.
- PATCH /api/notes/:id/unarchive: Unarchives a note by setting its archived field to false.

- DELETE /api/drawings/:id: Deletes a drawing from the database.

## üîÑ Process

The Notebook project follows a modular and scalable architecture with a clear separation between the frontend and backend components. React is used for building the frontend user interface, providing a component-based approach to UI development. On the backend, Node.js with Express.js powers the server-side logic, handling HTTP requests, data processing, and database interactions. PostgreSQL serves as the database management system for storing notes and drawings data, while Sequelize facilitates seamless communication between the Node.js application and the PostgreSQL database.Sharp library is employed for efficient image processing in the backend, ensuring optimal handling of drawings.
